        Restaurateurs excel at developing creative ideas for a business, serving
        delicious food, and creating fantastic guest experiences. And now,
        increasingly, a critical component of that guest experience is digital.
        Your website is the new front door of your business. As your restaurant
        perfects your digital ordering and takeout and delivery offerings, it’s
        more important than ever that your restaurant website is well-optimized,
        making it easy for guests to discover your restaurant online and find
        exactly what they’re looking for. <br />

        Restaurant owners now have a unique opportunity to tailor their guests’
        experiences, both online and in-person, to build loyalty and turn casual
        guests into consistent regulars. With 89% of diners researching
        restaurants online before visiting in-person, your website is the
        platform for your guests' first interaction with your business. Whether
        you're building the site yourself or hiring someone to do it for you,
        the most important aspect of creating an effective restaurant website
        design is that it efficiently conveys critical information while also
        enticing new customers. <br />
